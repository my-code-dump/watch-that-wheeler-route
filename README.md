# MPI Linear Search Algorithm
This program evenly splits a 1D vector across provided processes.  
The number of processes used are ***16, 32, 64***.  
This program is designed to test linear search scaling with different ammount of processes.

## Implementation

## Run on Wheeler
1. ssh on wheeler
```bash
module load openmpi/4.1.2-q2zi
```
2. Run compile script 
```bash 
qsub <runscript>
```
3. .o is the output
